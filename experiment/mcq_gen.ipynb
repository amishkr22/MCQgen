Agents & Logics \\n\\nLogical Agent\\nLogical agents uselogic tomake decisions andactintheworld .The two most common kinds of\\nlogics are:\\n●Propositional logic\\n●First-order logic\\nwhen thinking about logical agents, weimagine that theagent hasaknowledge base (KB) that\\ncontains logical sentences thatdescribe thestate oftheworld youcould think ofaKBasadatabase\\ndesigned forstoring andretrieving logical sentences there aretwo main KBoperations :TELL and\\nASK\\n●TELL puts anew factintotheKB\\n●ASK queries theKBabout what isknown ;thisusually involves inference, where theKBcan\\ndetermine thatfacts aretrue(orlikely tobetrue) even though they have notbeen explicitly told\\nthem\\n\\nLogical Agent\\n1)Propositional Logic(PL)\\n●Propositional logic (PL) isthesimplest form oflogic where allthestatements aremade by\\npropositions .\\n●Aproposition isadeclarative statement which iseither trueorfalse .\\n●Itisatechnique ofknowledge representation inlogical andmathematical form .\\nExamples\\na)ItisSunday .\\nb)TheSunrises from West (False proposition)\\nc)3+3=7(False proposition)\\nd)5isaprime number .\\n\\nLogical Agent\\n1)Propositional Logic(PL)\\n●Propositional logic isalsocalled Boolean logic asitworks on0and1.\\n●Inpropositional logic, weusesymbolic variables torepresent thelogic, andwecanuseany\\nsymbol forarepresenting aproposition, such A,B,C,P,Q,R,etc.\\n●Propositions canbeeither trueorfalse, butitcannot beboth.\\n●Propositional logic consists ofanobject, relations orfunction, andlogical connectives .\\n●These connectives arealsocalled logical operators .\\n●Thepropositions andconnectives arethebasic elements ofthepropositional logic .\\n●Connectives canbesaidasalogical operator which connects twosentences .\\n●Aproposition formula which isalways true iscalled tautology, anditisalso called avalid\\nsentence .\\n●Aproposition formula which isalways false iscalled Contradiction .\\n●Statements which arequestions, commands, oropinions arenotpropositions such as\"Where is\\nRohini\", \"How areyou\", \"What isyour name\", arenotpropositions .\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nSyntax ofPropositional Logic(PL)\\n●The syntax ofpropositional logic defines theallowable sentences fortheknowledge representation .\\nThere aretwotypes ofPropositions :\\na.Atomic Propositions :They arethesimple propositions .Itconsists ofasingle proposition symbol .These\\narethesentences which must beeither trueorfalse .\\nExample\\n2+2is4,itisanatomic proposition asitisatrue fact.\\n\"The Suniscold\" isalsoaproposition asitisafalse fact\\nb.Compound propositions :They areconstructed bycombining simpler oratomic propositions, using\\nparentheses andlogical connectives .\\n●Example\\n\"Itisraining today, andstreet iswet.\"\\n\"Ankit isadoctor, andhisclinic isinMumbai .\"\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nLogical Connectives inPropositional Logic(PL)\\n●Logical connectives areused toconnect twosimpler propositions orrepresenting asentence logically .\\nWecancreate compound propositions with thehelp oflogical connectives .\\n●There aremainly fiveconnectives, which aregiven asfollows :\\n1.Negation: A sentence such as ¬ P is called negation of P. A literal can be either Positive literal or \\nnegative literal.\\n2.Conjunction: A sentence which has ∧connective such as, P ∧Q is called a conjunction.\\nExample: Rohan is intelligent and hardworking. It can be written as,\\nP= Rohan is intelligent,\\nQ= Rohan is hardworking. → P ∧Q.\\n3.Disjunction: A sentence which has ∨connective, such as P ∨Q. is called disjunction, where P and Q \\nare the propositions.\\nExample: \"Ritika is a doctor or Engineer\",\\nHere P= Ritika is Doctor. Q= Ritika is Engineer, so we can write it as P ∨Q.\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nLogical Connectives inPropositional Logic(PL)\\n4) Implication: A sentence such as P → Q, is called an implication. Implications are also known as if -then \\nrules. It can be represented as\\nIf it is raining, then the street is wet.\\nLet P= It is raining, and Q= Street is wet, so it is represented as P → Q\\n5) Biconditional: A sentence such as P ⇔Q is a Biconditional sentence, example If I am breathing, then I am \\nalive\\nP= I am breathing, Q= I am alive, it can be represented as P ⇔Q.\\nLimitations\\n●Wecannot represent relations likeALL, some, ornone with propositional logic .Example :\\na.Allthegirls areintelligent .\\nb.Some apples aresweet .\\n●Propositional logic haslimited expressive power .\\n●Inpropositional logic, wecannot describe statements interms oftheir properties orlogical\\nrelationships\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nFirst Order Logic(FOL)\\n●Unfortunately, inpropositional logic (PL), wecanonly represent thefacts, which areeither true or\\nfalse .\\n●PLisnotsufficient torepresent thecomplex sentences ornatural language statements .\\n●Thepropositional logic hasvery limited expressive power .\\nConsider thefollowing sentence, which wecannot represent using PLlogic .\\n●\"Some humans areintelligent\", or\\n●\"Sachin likes cricket .\"\\nTorepresent theabove statements, PLlogic isnotsufficient, sowerequired some more powerful logic, such\\nasfirst-order logic .\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nFirst Order Logic(FOL)/Predicate Logic/First Order Predicate Logic\\n●First-order logic isanother way ofknowledge representation inartificial intelligence .\\n●Itisanextension topropositional logic .\\n●FOL issufficiently expressive torepresent thenatural language statements inaconcise way.\\n●First-order logic isapowerful language thatdevelops information about theobjects inamore easy way\\nandcanalsoexpress therelationship between those objects .\\n●First-order logic (like natural language) does notonly assume that theworld contains facts like\\npropositional logic butalsoassumes thefollowing things intheworld :\\n●Objects :A,B,people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, pits\\n●Relations :Itcanbeunary relation such as:red,round, isadjacent, orn-anyrelation such as:the\\nsister of,brother of,hascolor, comes between\\n● Function :Father of,bestfriend, third inning of,endof...\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nFirst Order Logic(FOL)/Predicate Logic/First Order Predicate Logic\\nAsanatural language, first-order logic alsohastwomain parts :Syntax andSemantics\\nSyntax ofFOL\\nThe syntax ofFOL determines which collection ofsymbols isalogical expression infirst-order logic .The\\nbasic syntactic elements offirst-order logic aresymbols .Wewrite statements inshort -hand notation inFOL .\\nAtomic Sentences\\n●Atomic sentences arethemost basic sentences offirst-order logic .These sentences areformed from a\\npredicate symbol followed byaparenthesis with asequence ofterms .\\n●Wecanrepresent atomic sentences asPredicate (term 1,term 2...term n).\\nExample :Ravi andAjay arebrothers :=>Brothers (Ravi, Ajay)\\nChinky isacat:=>cat(Chinky)\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nFirst Order Logic(FOL)/Predicate Logic/First Order Predicate Logic\\nSyntax ofFOL\\nComplex Sentences\\n●Complex sentences aremade bycombining atomic sentences using connectives .\\nFirst-order logic statements canbedivided intotwoparts :\\n●Subject :Subject isthemain partofthestatement .\\n●Predicate :Apredicate canbedefined asarelation, which binds twoatoms together inastatement .\\nConsider thestatement :\"xisaninteger\" ,itconsists oftwo parts, thefirst part xisthesubject ofthe\\nstatement andsecond part\"isaninteger,\" isknown asapredicate .\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nSemantic( relating to meaning in language or logic )of FOL\\n●Ansemantic ofFOL assigns anotation toallsymbols .\\n●Italsodetermines adomain thatspecifies therange ofquantifiers .\\n●Each term isassigned asanobject, each predicate isassigned aproperty ofobjects andeach sentence\\nisassigned atruevalue .\\n●Inthisway FOL provides meaning totheterms, thepredicates andformulas ofthelanguage .\\nInterpretation onFOL\\n●Domain Dbeannonempty set\\n●Each constant isassigned anelement ofD\\n●Each variable isassigned tosubset ofD\\n●Each function \\'f\\'of\\'m\\'isdefined onmarguments ofDanddefines amapping from DmtoD.\\n\\nLogical Agent\\nSemantic of FOL\\nExpression \\'E\\'andinterpretation \\'I\\'for\\'E\\'\\n●Thevalue ofTruth symbol TandF\\n●Thevalue ofatomic sentence iseither TorFdetermined byinterpretation I\\n●Thevalue ofconstant istheelement ofD,assigned byI\\n●Value ofvariables issetofelements ofD,assigned by\\'I\\'\\nThe value offunction expression isthat element ofDobtained byevaluating thefunction for\\nparameter values assigned byI.\\nThevalue ofnegation ofsentence isTrue ifvalue ofsentence isfalse andvice andversa .\\nThevalue ofconjunction oftwosentence istrueifboth aretrueotherwise false .\\nThetruevalue ofexpression using aredetermined form thevalue ofother operands\\n\\nKnowledge based Agent\\n●Anintelligent agent needs knowledge about therealworld fortaking decisions andreasoning to\\nactefficiently .\\n●Knowledge -based agents arethose agents who have thecapability ofmaintaining aninternal\\nstate ofknowledge, reason over thatknowledge, update their knowledge after observations and\\ntake actions .\\n●These agents canrepresent theworld with some formal representation and actintelligently .\\nKnowledge -based agents arecomposed oftwomain parts :\\no    Knowledge -base: domain specific content  and\\no    Inference system: Domain Independent system\\n\\nKnowledge based Agent\\nA knowledge -based agent must able to do the following:\\n●An agent should be able to represent states, actions, etc.\\n●An agent Should be able to incorporate new percepts\\n●An agent can update the internal representation of the world\\n●An agent can deduce the internal representation of the world\\n●An agent can deduce appropriate actions.\\n●Theabove diagram isrepresenting ageneralized architecture foraknowledge -based agent .\\n●Theknowledge -based agent (KBA) take input from theenvironment byperceiving theenvironment .\\n●Theinput istaken bytheinference engine oftheagent andwhich also communicate with KBtodecide asper\\ntheknowledge store inKB.\\n●Thelearning element ofKBA regularly updates theKBbylearning new knowledge .\\n\\nKnowledge based Agent\\n●Knowledge -base isacentral component ofaknowledge -based agent, itisalsoknown asKB.\\n●Itisacollection ofsentences (here \\'sentence\\' isatechnical term anditisnotidentical tosentence in\\nEnglish) .\\n●These sentences areexpressed inalanguage which iscalled aknowledge representation language .\\n●TheKnowledge -base ofKBA stores factabout theworld .\\n●Knowledge -base isrequired forupdating knowledge foranagent tolearn with experiences andtake\\naction aspertheknowledge .\\nFollowing arethree operations which areperformed byKBA inorder toshow theintelligent behavior :\\n1.TELL :This operation tells theknowledge base what itperceives from theenvironment .\\n2.ASK :This operation asks theknowledge base what action itshould perform .\\n3.Perform :Itperforms theselected action .\\n\\nKnowledge based Agent\\n●Theknowledge -based agent takes percept asinput andreturns anaction asoutput .\\n●Theagent maintains theknowledge base, KB, anditinitially hassome background knowledge\\noftherealworld .\\n●Italso hasacounter toindicate thetime forthewhole process, andthiscounter isinitialized\\nwith zero.\\nEach time when thefunction iscalled, itperforms itsthree operations :\\n●Firstly itTELLs theKBwhat itperceives .\\n●Secondly, itasks KBwhat action itshould take\\n●Third agent program TELLS theKBthatwhich action waschosen .\\n\\nKnowledge based Agent\\nApproaches\\nThere aremainly twoapproaches tobuild aknowledge -based agent :\\n1.Declarative approach :\\n●Wecancreate aknowledge -based agent byinitializing with anempty knowledge base andtelling\\ntheagent allthesentences with which wewant tostart with.\\n●This approach iscalled Declarative approach .\\n2.Procedural approach :\\n●Intheprocedural approach, wedirectly encode desired behavior asaprogram code .\\n●Which means wejustneed towrite aprogram thatalready encodes thedesired behavior oragent .\\n\\nPropositional Theorem Proving\\n●Wecanshow how entailment canbedone bytheorem proving that isapplying rules ofinference\\ndirectly tothesentences inourknowledge base toconstruct asproof ofthedesired sentence without\\nconsulting models .\\n●Logical equivalence :Two sentences Alpha andBeta arelogically equivalent ifthey aretrue inthe\\nsame setofmodels .\\nwewrite thisAlpha =Beta .Forexample wecaneasily show (using truth table) thatP^Q andQ^P are\\nlogically equivalent .\\n●Tautological means Result should betrue\\n\\nPropositional Theorem Proving\\n\\nPropositional Theorem Proving\\n\\nAgents based on Propositional Logic\\n●Agent need todeduce theword given percepts .weneed complete logic models .weneed agent tokeep the\\ntrack oftheworld .weneed agent tomake plans .\\n●Theknowledge base isused bytheagent fordeducing what todo?.\\n●Knowledge base hasAxioms(sentences that are true without proof) andpercept sentences from agent\\nexperiences .\\n●Apartoftheworld thatchanges issaidtobefluent(state variable) .\\n●Permanent aspect without needing atime stamp arecalled Atemporal variables .\\n1)Assert thelocation fluent\\n2)Setofsentences toserve astransition model totrack thefluent\\n3)Need prepositional symbols foractions indexed bytime\\n4)Percept fortime goes firstandtheaction\\n\\nAgents based on Propositional Logic\\n●Werequire sentences foreach times, each direction and thesame fortheother actions likeGrab, shoot, climb,\\nturnleft,turnright .\\n●Consider when theagent moves forward ,thisfactgoes intoKB.\\n●When weforgot toinclude what hasremain unchanged, theneed ofthisleads toframe problem .\\n●Toresolve thisproblem wecanaddfrom axioms butthisisreally inefficient .This specific problem often iscalled\\nasrepresentational frame problem .\\n●Toresolve thisproblem wecanwrite axioms about fluent notactions .\\n●With successor state axioms andpreviously defined axioms theagent canASK anything thatcanbeanswered in\\ntheworld .\\n●Use ofhybrid agent which combine condition action rules .This agent keeps anupdate plan andKB.KBis\\ninitialized with atemporal axioms .\\n●Inthisastime passes new percept axioms areadded andallaxioms related totime( Successor time axioms) .\\n●Theagent moves inferences byusing ASK todetermine safemoves .\\n\\nUsing First Order Logic\\n●Assertions andqueries inFOL\\n●Adding sentences toKBusing TELL called assertion\\n●Assertions :John isking, Richard isaperson, andallkings areperson\\n●Askquestions oftheKBusing ASK\\nreturn truevalue\\n●Questions arecalled queries orgoals .queries arelogically entailed byKB should beanswered\\naffirmatively should return truetoo\\nUniversal Quantifier\\n∃: means there exists\\n∀: for  all, for any\\nUsing First Order Logic\\n●canaskquantified queries\\nlikeasking fortime andgetting theanswer true\\n●How about asking about what makes something true\\nGetstring ofanswers\\n●Consider family relations\\nExample facts :Eisamother ofC,Cisthefather ofW,Ones grandmother ismother ofone\\'s parent\\nObjects indomain arepeople\\n●Two unary predicate :male, female\\n●Kinship relations arebinary predicates :parents, siblings ,brother, sister, child, daughter, son,spouse, etc\\n●Functions ofmother andfather, each person hasexactly one\\n\\nUsing First Order Logic\\n●Consider each function andpredicate expressed interms ofother symbols\\nThe sentence areaxioms inthedomain where\\naxiom arefundamental facts\\n●Provides basic factual information for\\nderiving useful conclusions\\n●Also definitions, defining functions, and\\npredicate interms ofother predicate\\n●Kind oflike how software packages are\\nbuilt upbydefinitions offunctions using\\nlibrary functions\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n●The process ofconstructing aknowledge -base in\\nfirst-order logic iscalled asknowledge -engineering .\\n●TheKnowledge Engineering Process\\n●Following aresome main steps oftheknowledge -\\nengineering process .Using these steps, wewill\\ndevelop aknowledge base which will allow usto\\nreason about digital circuit (One-bitfull adder )\\nwhich isshown here\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n1.Identify thetask\\nThe first step oftheprocess istoidentify thetask, andforthedigital circuit,\\nthere arevarious reasoning tasks .\\nAtthefirst level orhighest level, wewill examine thefunctionality ofthe\\ncircuit :\\n●Does thecircuit addproperly?\\n●What willbetheoutput ofgate A2,ifalltheinputs arehigh?\\nAtthesecond level, wewillexamine thecircuit structure details\\n●Which gate isconnected tothefirstinput terminal?\\n●Does thecircuit have feedback loops ?\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n2.Assemble therelevant knowledge\\nInthesecond step, wewillassemble therelevant knowledge which isrequired fordigital circuits .Sofordigital\\ncircuits, wehave thefollowing required knowledge :\\n●Logic circuits aremade upofwires andgates .\\n●Signal flows through wires totheinput terminal ofthegate, andeach gate produces thecorresponding\\noutput which flows further .\\n●Inthislogic circuit, there arefour types ofgates used:AND, OR, XOR, andNOT .\\n●Allthese gates have oneoutput terminal andtwo input terminals (except NOT gate, ithasoneinput\\nterminal) .\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n3.Decide onVocabulary\\n●The next step oftheprocess istoselect functions, predicate, andconstants torepresent thecircuits,\\nterminals, signals, andgates .\\n● Firstly wewilldistinguish thegates from each other andfrom other objects .\\n●Each gate isrepresented asanobject which isnamed byaconstant, such as,Gate(X 1).\\n●Thefunctionality ofeach gate isdetermined byitstype, which istaken asconstants such asAND, OR,\\nXOR, orNOT .\\n●Circuits willbeidentified byapredicate :Circuit (C1).\\n●Fortheterminal, wewillusepredicate :Terminal(x) .\\n●Forgate input, wewillusethefunction In(1,X1)fordenoting thefirst input terminal ofthegate, and\\nforoutput terminal wewilluseOut (1,X1).\\n●Thefunction Arity(c, i,j)isused todenote thatcircuit chasiinput, joutput .\\n●Theconnectivity between gates canberepresented bypredicate Connect(Out( 1,X1),In(1,X1)).\\n●Weuseaunary predicate On(t),which istrueifthesignal ataterminal ison.\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n4.Encode general knowledge ofthedomain\\n5.Encode adescription oftheproblem instance :\\n●Now weencode problem ofcircuit C1,firstly wecategorize thecircuit anditsgate components .\\n●This stepiseasy ifontology about theproblem isalready thought .\\n●This step involves thewriting simple atomics sentences ofinstances ofconcepts, which isknown as\\nontology .\\n●Forthegiven circuit C1,wecanencode theproblem instance inatomic sentences asbelow :\\n●Since inthecircuit there aretwoXOR, twoAND, andoneORgate soatomic sentences forthese gates\\nwillbe:\\n1.ForXOR gate:Type(x 1)=XOR, Type(X 2)=XOR\\n2.ForAND gate:Type(A 1)=AND, Type(A 2)=AND\\n3.ForORgate:Type (O1)=OR.\\nAnd then represent theconnections between allthegates .\\n\\nKnowledge Engineering in FOL\\n6.Pose queries to the inference procedure and get answers:\\n●Inthisstep, wewillfindallthepossible setofvalues ofalltheterminal fortheadder circuit .\\n●The first query will be:What should bethecombination ofinput which would generate thefirst\\noutput ofcircuit C1,as0andasecond output tobe1?\\n7.Debug the knowledge base:\\n●Now wewilldebug theknowledge base, andthisisthelaststepofthecomplete process .\\n●Inthisstep, wewilltrytodebug theissues ofknowledge base.\\n●Intheknowledge base, wemay have omitted assertions like1≠0.\\n\\nDifference between Propositional & Predicate Logic\\n1. Propositional Logic :\\nA proposition is basically a declarative sentence that has a truth value. \\n●Truth value can either be true or false, but it needs to be assigned any of the two values and not be \\nambiguous. \\n●The purpose of using propositional logic is to analyze a statement, individually or compositely.\\nFor example :\\nThe following statements : \\n1.If x is real, then x2 > 0\\n2.What is your name?\\n3.(a+b)2 = 100\\n4.This statement is true.\\nAre not propositions because they do not have a truth value. They are ambiguous.\\n\\nDifference between Propositional & Predicate Logic\\n●But the following statements : \\n1.(a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2\\n2.If x is real, then x2 >= 0\\n3.If x is real, then x2 < 0\\n4.The sun rises in the east.\\n5.The sun rises in the west.\\n●Are all propositions because they have a specific truth value, true or false.\\n●The branch of logic that deals with proposition is propositional logic .\\n\\nDifference between Propositional & Predicate Logic\\n2. Predicate Logic :\\n●Predicates are properties, additional information to better express the subject of the sentence. \\n●A quantified predicate is a proposition , that is, when you assign values to a predicate with \\nvariables it can be made a proposition.\\nFor example :\\nIn P(x) : x>5, x is the subject or the variable and ‘>5’ is the predicate.\\nP(7) : 7>5 is a proposition where we are assigning values to the variable x, and it has a truth value, \\ni.e. True.\\n\\nDifference between Propositional & Predicate Logic\\nPropositional Logic Predicate Logic\\nDeals with acollection ofdeclarative statements\\nwhich have atruth value, trueorfalse .Itisanexpression consisting ofvariables with a\\nspecified domain .Itconsists ofobjects, relations\\nandfunctions between theobjects .\\nItisthebasic andmost widely used logic .Also\\nknown asBoolean logic .Itisanextension ofpropositional logic covering\\npredicates andquantification .\\nAproposition hasaspecific truth value, either true\\norfalse .Apredicate truth value depends onthevariables’\\nvalue .\\nScope analysis isnotdone inpropositional logic .Predicate logic helps analyze thescope ofthe\\nsubject over thepredicate .\\nDifference between Propositional & Predicate Logic\\nPropositional Logic Predicate Logic\\nPropositions arecombined with Logical Operators\\nor Logical Connectives like Negation(¬),\\nDisjunction( ∨), Conjunction( ∧), Exclusive\\nOR(⊕),Implication( ⇒),Bi-Conditional or\\nDouble Implication( ⇔).Predicate Logic adds byintroducing quantifiers to\\ntheexisting proposition .\\nItisamore generalized representation . Itisamore specialized representation .\\nItcannot deal with setsofentities .Itcandeal with setofentities with thehelp of\\nquantifiers .\\nReasoning\\n●The reasoning isthemental process ofderiving logical conclusion andmaking predictions from\\navailable knowledge, facts, andbeliefs .Orwecansay, \"Reasoning isaway toinfer facts from\\nexisting data .\"\\n●Itisageneral process ofthinking rationally, tofindvalid conclusions .\\n●Inartificial intelligence, thereasoning isessential sothatthemachine canalso think rationally asa\\nhuman brain, andcanperform likeahuman .\\nTypes ofReasoning\\nInartificial intelligence, reasoning canbedivided intothefollowing categories :\\n○Deductive reasoning, Inductive reasoning, Abductive reasoning, Common Sense\\nReasoning,Monotonic Reasoning,Non -monotonic Reasoning .\\n\\nReasoning\\n1)Deductive Reasoning\\n●Deductive reasoning isdeducing new information from logically related known information .\\nItistheform ofvalid reasoning, which means theargument\\'s conclusion must betrue when\\nthepremises aretrue.\\n●Deductive reasoning isatype ofpropositional logic inAI,anditrequires various rules and\\nfacts .\\n●Itissometimes referred toastop-down reasoning, andcontradictory toinductive reasoning .\\n●Indeductive reasoning, thetruth ofthepremises guarantees thetruth oftheconclusion .\\n●Deductive reasoning mostly starts from thegeneral premises tothespecific conclusion\\n\\nReasoning\\nExample :\\nPremise -1:Allthehuman eatsveggies\\nPremise -2:Suresh ishuman .\\nConclusion :Suresh eatsveggies .\\nThegeneral process ofdeductive reasoning isgiven below :\\n\\nReasoning\\n2)Inductive Reasoning\\n●Inductive reasoning isaform ofreasoning toarrive ataconclusion using limited setsoffacts\\nbytheprocess ofgeneralization .Itstarts with theseries ofspecific facts ordata andreaches\\ntoageneral statement orconclusion .\\n●Inductive reasoning isatype ofpropositional logic, which isalso known ascause -effect\\nreasoning orbottom -upreasoning .\\n●Ininductive reasoning, weusehistorical data orvarious premises togenerate ageneric rule,\\nforwhich premises support theconclusion .\\n●Ininductive reasoning, premises provide probable supports totheconclusion, sothetruth of\\npremises does notguarantee thetruth oftheconclusion .\\n\\nReasoning\\n2)Inductive Reasoning\\n●Inductive reasoning isaform ofreasoning toarrive ataconclusion using limited setsoffacts\\nbytheprocess ofgeneralization .Itstarts with theseries ofspecific facts ordata andreaches\\ntoageneral statement orconclusion .\\n●Inductive reasoning isatype ofpropositional logic, which isalso known ascause -effect\\nreasoning orbottom -upreasoning .\\n●Ininductive reasoning, weusehistorical data orvarious premises togenerate ageneric rule,\\nforwhich premises support theconclusion .\\n●Ininductive reasoning, premises provide probable supports totheconclusion, sothetruth of\\npremises does notguarantee thetruth oftheconclusion .\\n\\nReasoning\\nExample :\\nPremise :Allofthepigeons wehave seen inthezooarewhite .\\nConclusion :Therefore, wecanexpect allthepigeons tobewhit e.\\n\\nReasoning\\n3)Abductive Reasoning\\nAbductive reasoning isaform oflogical reasoning which starts with single ormultiple\\nobservations then seeks tofindthemost likely explanation orconclusion fortheobservation .\\nAbductive reasoning isanextension ofdeductive reasoning, butinabductive reasoning, the\\npremises donotguarantee theconclusion .\\nExample :\\nImplication :Cricket ground iswetifitisraining\\nAxiom :Cricket ground iswet.\\nConclusion Itisraining .\\n\\nReasoning\\n4)Common Sense Reasoning\\n●Common sense reasoning isaninformal form ofreasoning, which canbegained through\\nexperiences .\\n●Common Sense reasoning simulates thehuman ability tomake presumptions about events\\nwhich occurs onevery day.\\n●Itrelies ongood judgment rather than exact logic andoperates onheuristic knowledge and\\nheuristic rules .\\nExample :\\n1.One person can be at one place at a time.\\n2.If I put my hand in a fire, then it will burn.\\n●Theabove twostatements aretheexamples ofcommon sense reasoning which ahuman mind\\ncaneasily understand andassume .\\n\\nReasoning\\n5)Monotonic Reasoning\\n●Inmonotonic reasoning, once theconclusion istaken, then itwill remain thesame even ifweadd\\nsome other information toexisting information inourknowledge base.Inmonotonic reasoning,\\nadding knowledge does notdecrease thesetofprepositions thatcanbederived .\\n●Tosolve monotonic problems, wecanderive thevalid conclusion from theavailable facts only, and\\nitwillnotbeaffected bynew facts .\\n●Monotonic reasoning isnotuseful forthereal-time systems, asinrealtime, facts getchanged, sowe\\ncannot usemonotonic reasoning .\\n●Monotonic reasoning isused inconventional reasoning systems, and alogic -based system is\\nmonotonic .\\n●Any theorem proving isanexample ofmonotonic reasoning .\\n\\nReasoning\\nExample :\\n○Earth revolves around the Sun.\\nItisatrue fact, anditcannot bechanged even ifweaddanother sentence inknowledge base like, \"The\\nmoon revolves around theearth\" Or\"Earth isnotround,\" etc.\\nAdvantages ofMonotonic Reasoning :\\n○In monotonic reasoning, each old proof will always remain valid.\\n○If we deduce some facts from available facts, then it will remain valid for always.\\nDisadvantages ofMonotonic Reasoning :\\n○We cannot represent the real world scenarios using Monotonic reasoning.\\n○Hypothesis knowledge cannot be expressed with monotonic reasoning, which means facts should be \\ntrue.\\n○so new knowledge from the real world cannot be added.\\n\\nReasoning\\n6)Non-monotonic Reasoning\\n●InNon-monotonic reasoning, some conclusions may beinvalidated ifweadd some more\\ninformation toourknowledge base.\\n●Logic will besaid asnon-monotonic ifsome conclusions can beinvalidated byadding more\\nknowledge intoourknowledge base.\\n●Non-monotonic reasoning deals with incomplete anduncertain models .\\n●\"Human perceptions forvarious things indaily life, \"isageneral example ofnon-monotonic\\nreasoning .\\n\\nReasoning\\nExample :Letsuppose theknowledge base contains thefollowing knowledge :\\n○Birds can fly\\n○Penguins cannot fly\\n○Pitty is a bird\\nSofrom theabove sentences, wecanconclude thatPitty canfly.\\nHowever, ifweaddoneanother sentence into knowledge base \"Pitty isapenguin \",which concludes\\n\"Pitty cannot fly\",soitinvalidates theabove conclusion .\\n\\nReasoning\\nAdvantages ofNon-monotonic reasoning :\\n○For real -world systems such as Robot navigation, we can use non -monotonic reasoning.\\n○In Non -monotonic reasoning, we can choose probabilistic facts or can make assumptions.\\nDisadvantages ofNon-monotonic Reasoning :\\n○In non -monotonic reasoning, the old facts may be invalidated by adding new sentences.\\n○It cannot be used for theorem proving .\\n\\nReasoning\\n○Consider thefollowing twoexamples tobetter understand how reasoning works inartificial\\nintelligence applications andsystems :\\n1.Alexa :isacognitive virtual assistant that employs reasoning tomake recommendations and\\nsuggestions based onorders .Forinstance, theclosest place, thedate fortomorrow, theAM and\\nPM, andsoon.\\n2.WolframAlpha :Todomathematical computations based onmeal portions, thiscomputational\\nknowledge engine uses reasoning .\\n○Inbrief, machines, likehumans, usereasoning, knowledge representation, logic, andlearning\\ntoanalyze, solve problems, draw conclusions, andmore .\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n',\n",
